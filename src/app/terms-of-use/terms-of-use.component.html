  </p>
  <p>Househelp — a person offering domestic services (cooking, cleaning, childcare, etc.) via the Platform.
  </p>
  <p> Agent — an authorised party who assists with registering or managing househelps or homeowners.
  </p>
  <p>Service(s) — listing, search, messaging, booking, payment facilitation, ratings, profiles, and other services offered on the Platform.
  </p>
  <p>
    Account — the user account you create to access the Platform.
  </p>

  <h2> 2. Acceptance & Eligibility</h2>
  <p>  You must be at least 18 years old and legally able to enter into contracts under Kenyan law to create an Account.
  </p>
  <p>By using the Platform you confirm you have the authority to bind any organisation you represent.

  <p> We may refuse service, suspend or terminate Accounts at our discretion, including for breaches of these Terms.
  </p>

  <h2>  3. Scope of Services</h2>
  <p>  The Platform connects Homeowners and Househelps and provides tools for searching, communicating, booking, and (where applicable) processing payments.
  </p>
  <p>We do not employ Househelps nor are we an employer for any Househelp; Househelps are independent service providers unless explicitly contracted otherwise.
  </p>
  <p> We may introduce subscription products, premium listings, or agent-managed services as described on the Platform.
  </p>

  <h2> 4. Accounts, Registration & Security</h2>
  <p>
    You must provide accurate, complete and up-to-date information at registration and keep it current.

  </p>
  <p>
    You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Account credentials and for all activity under your Account.

  </p>
  <p>
    You must notify us immediately if you suspect unauthorised use of your Account.
  </p>
  <p>
    We may require identity verification and supporting documents.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Profiles, Content & Representations</h2>

  <p> Users warrant that information they post (profiles, photos, certificates) is accurate and not misleading.
  </p>
  <p> Househelps must disclose any material facts affecting their ability to perform services (e.g., criminal convictions, inability to perform childcare duties).
  </p>
  <p>By posting content you grant Yaya a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free licence to use, modify and display that content for Platform operations and promotion.
  </p>

  <h2> 6. Vetting, Background Checks & Verification</h2>

  <p> We may offer or require verification services (identity, background checks). These checks are performed by third parties and are indicative only.
  </p>
  <p>Homeowners should exercise independent judgment and may require additional checks (references, interviews). We do not guarantee the accuracy of third-party checks.
  </p>
  <p> Important: We do not guarantee suitability or safety of any Househelp. Homeowners engage Househelps at their own risk.
  </p>

  <h2> 7. Bookings, Hiring & Payments</h2>
 <p> Booking terms (duration, scope, fee, cancellation policy) are agreed between the Homeowner and Househelp at booking.
 </p>

  <p>
    Where we facilitate payment (for example, via M-Pesa/Daraja or card gateways), payments may be processed by third-party payment providers. Payment processing is subject to the provider’s terms and applicable laws.
  </p>
  <p>
    Fees (platform commissions, subscription fees) will be disclosed at the time of purchase or in your subscription agreement.
  </p>
  <p> Refunds and chargebacks: subject to the Platform’s refund policy and applicable payment provider rules.
  </p>

  <h2>  8. Subscriptions & Automatic Renewal
  </h2>

  <p> Subscription services (if any) auto-renew unless cancelled per the cancellation policy. Cancellation requests must be made through the Platform or customer support.
  </p>

  <p> No refunds for unused subscription periods except as required by law or our refund policy.

  <h2> 9. Cancellations & No-shows</h2>

  <p> Cancellation windows, penalties, and notice periods will be set out in each booking. Parties should agree in writing where possible.
  </p>

  <p>We may impose penalties (fees, suspensions) for repeated cancellations or no-shows in accordance with posted rules.
  </p>

  <h2> 10. Pricing & Taxes
